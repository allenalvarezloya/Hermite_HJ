# Hermite_HJ
Examples of solving Hamilton-Jacobi Equations using Hermite methods.

For each example folder contains a file simulation.m which computes and plots numerical solution. There is also a file errors.m which computes the L1,L2 and L-infinity norms along 
with estimated rates of convergence.
